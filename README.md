### Brian
Brian is designed to be a personal assistant with a goal to give to my life a little more of organization
and productivity.

### How
I've thought about a few sections that I want to cover and transform into Brian skills:

- Accept voice commands and a give a conversational answer
- Handle ordinary tasks (schedule events, turn on/off electrical devices)
- Knowledge growth (Create a internal database to store his knowledge development)
- Fluently speak
- Hot keywork (Hey, Brian!)
- Audio Sample Analyzing (Voice recognition)
- Face Recognition
- Social network database
- Smart home control
- Musician

### Tech stack:
Until now, I've concentrated my efforts into JS, I'm using a compromise to NLP, AWS Polly to voice syntethize, Firebase to local database, and a few baby steps into machine learning using
Brain.JS and Synaptic to combine neural networks solutions.
