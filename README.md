## Tech stack:
I'm using a compromise to NLP, AWS Polly to voice syntethize, mongodb as local database, and a few baby steps into machine learning using Brain.JS and Synaptic to combine neural networks approachs to improve brian understanding.

## How Brian works?

Brian is a polite, friendly and nice personal life helper, written in Node JS consuming a few apis to charge his powers, having Jarvis as his uncle it's easy to be awesome.

Divided into two major parts (his Brain and interface) to make the running environment more flexible. The idea is to run a server into a more capable device (as A PI 3B+ or a unix machine) and widgets installed to receive outputs (as anothers PI's zeros for example).

Brian was designed to be a personal assistant with a goal. Give to life a little more of organization
productivity and facility, with privacy.

## Architectural Scheme

NOTE: It's possible to run brian for almost any device running Node JS with audio in and output, tested on MacOSX, Ubuntu, Mint and Raspbian.

# Integrations
As mentioned Brian is connected to a few services to charge his powers, they are described below:
  - [Parallel Dots](https://www.paralleldots.com/) as AI Interface DIY
  - [MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com/) to routes and traffic information
  - Spotify for music control and home ambientantion
